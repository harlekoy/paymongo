> ## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require luigel/laravel-paymongo
```

**Laravel 6 and up** uses Package Auto-Discovery, so doesn't require you to manually add the ServiceProvider.

Put your `Secret Key` and `Public Key` in you `.env` file.

```
PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY=
PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY=
```

> ## Compatibility and Supported Versions
Laravel-Paymongo supports Laravel 6.* and 7.*

> ## Usage

> ### Tokens
>
> ### Create Token

Creates a one-time use token representing your customer's credit card details. NOTE: This token can only be used once to create a Payment. You must create separate tokens for every payment attempt.

**Sample**

```php
use Luigel\Paymongo\Facades\Paymongo;

$token = Paymongo::token()->create([
    'number' => '4242424242424242',
    'exp_month' => 12,
    'exp_year' => 25,
    'cvc' => "123",
]);
```

> ### Get Token

Retrieve a token given an ID. The prefix for the id is `tok_` followed by a unique hash representing the token. Just pass the token id to `find($id)` method.

**Sample**

```php
use Luigel\Paymongo\Facades\Paymongo;

$token = Paymongo::token()->find($tokenId);
```

> ### Payments
>
> ### Create Payment

To charge a payment source, you must create a Payment object. When in test mode, your payment sources won't actually be charged. You can select specific payment sources for different success and failure scenarios.

**Payload**

Refer to [Paymongo documentation](https://developers.paymongo.com/reference#create-a-payment) for payload guidelines.

**Sample**

```php
use Luigel\Paymongo\Facades\Paymongo;

$payment = Paymongo::payment()->create([
    'amount' => 100.00,
    'currency' => 'PHP',
    'description' => 'A testing Payment',
    'statement_descriptor' => 'LUIGEL STORE',
    'source' => [
        'id' => 'tok_Jt7WJhH4eQaEEZqWxdXW3sz5',
        'type' => 'token'
    ]
]);
```

> ### Get Payment

You can retrieve a Payment by providing a payment ID. The prefix for the id is `pay_` followed by a unique hash representing the payment. Just pass the payment id to `find($paymentId)` method.

**Sample**

```php
use Luigel\Paymongo\Facades\Paymongo;

$payment = Paymongo::payment()->find('pay_i35wBzLNdX8i9nKEPaSKWGib');
```

> ### Get all Payments

Returns all the payments you previously created, with the most recent payments returned first. Currently, all payments are returned as one batch. We will be introducing pagination and limits in the next iteration of the API.

**Sample**

```php
use Luigel\Paymongo\Facades\Paymongo;

$payments = Paymongo::payment()->all();
```

> ### Sources
>
> ### Create Source
>
> Creates a source to let the user pay using their [Gcash Accounts](https://www.gcash.com).

**Payload**

Refer to [Paymongo documentation](https://developers.paymongo.com/reference#post_sources-1) for payload guidelines.

**Sample**

```php
use Luigel\Paymongo\Facades\Paymongo;

$source = Paymongo::source()->create([
    'type' => 'gcash',
    'amount' => 100.00,
    'currency' => 'PHP',
    'redirect' => [
        'success' => 'https://your-domain.com/success',
        'failed' => 'https://your-domain.com/failed'
    ]
]);
```

> ### Webhooks
>
> ### Create Webhook
>
> Creates a webhook.

**Payload**

Refer to [Paymongo documentation](https://developers.paymongo.com/reference#post_webhooks-1) for payload guidelines.

**Sample**

```php
use Luigel\Paymongo\Facades\Paymongo;

$webhook = Paymongo::webhook()->create([
    'url' => 'http://your-domain/webhook/source-chargeable',
    'events' => [
        'source.chargeable'
    ]
]);
```

> ### List all Webhooks

Returns all the webhooks you previously created, with the most recent webhooks returned first.

**Sample**

```php
use Luigel\Paymongo\Facades\Paymongo;

$webhook = Paymongo::webhook()->all();
```

> ### Enable or Disable Webhooks

Set the webhook enable or disable.

**Sample**

```php
use Luigel\Paymongo\Facades\Paymongo;
// Enable webhook
$webhook = Paymongo::webhook()->find('hook_9VrvpRkkYqK6twbhuvcVTtjM')->enable();

// Disable webhook
$webhook = Paymongo::webhook()->find('hook_9VrvpRkkYqK6twbhuvcVTtjM')->disable();
```

> ### Update Webhook

```php
use Luigel\Paymongo\Facades\Paymongo;

$webhook = Paymongo::webhook()->find('hook_9VrvpRkkYqK6twbhuvcVTtjM')->update([
